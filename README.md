Free and simple to use online FTP client

## Warning
This project is still in early development and only a limited set of features
presently work

## Pull Requests
I am now happy to begin accepting pull requests. Please be aware that any major changes
(eg. feature additions) will require discussion before they are accepted.

## PHP Version
For now, we are using PHP version 5.6. As the project progresses, this may change.

## Test FTP Server
This project does not currently use any ssl encryption on ftp connections.
Therefore, you may wish to use a public FTP server for testing.

http://www.rebex.net/ provide a read-only FTP server free of charge, which you can
connect to with the following details:
- Host: test.rebex.net
- Port: 21
- Username: demo
- Password: password
